### Survey on Mental Health in Tech Companies

- Final project for Introduction to Machine Learning and Data mining course
- The main aim of the project was to predict whether a professional sought treatment or not
- Imported the dataset from Kaggle and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Developed Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees Machine Learning models for making predictions
- Created an ensemble model using various classification models, as mentioned earlier, achieving an overall accuracy of 80%
- Built an R Shiny application to predict the treatment status of an individual in real-time and deployed the application on Heroku
- Designed interactive dashboards and visualizations to represent the treatment status of a professional concerning their Family History, Gender, and Number of Employees
